# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project I chose was project 2 which was for Airgead Banking where we had to create a program that will teach students how to properly invest. It focused on ting and the power of compound interest. We developed an application that allowed the students to see how their investments would grow overtime.

What did you do particularly well?

I think what went well for my in this project was the display and how cohesive this application was. I was particularly proud of myself for laying out the variables correctly with the float method "float initInv, monDep, AnuInt, years, months;". I feel like this was the cleanest project I had as well, meaning I followed industry standards as far as commenting and correct indentation. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

With the right tools and practice I would have love to incorporate security within the application. I think added a pin number before entering your information would be extremely useful with privacy of the user!  

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I had a difficult time using Eclipse with this project - so to do the project within a timely manner I switched over to Xcode by Apple. This software was easy to use and properly displayed my work so I just went for it. I would love to easy use Eclipse however it is not supported by Mac - I'm working on another solution so i can properly use it! 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I love how this project was set up like an actual client. I think this will help me in the future when dealing with real clients. As for the code it taught me a lot about looping and iterating through code - which I struggled with in the beginning. I used iteration with the years selection such as "for(int j=0; j<12; j++){"

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure the program was laid out smoothly and easy to read. I made sure the display of the application was cohesive and everything was spelled correctly. I feel like I made it adaptable with very few buttons to press for the user.
